# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This project features client-side JS with JQuery and Ajax, interacting with a prebuilt Node + Express server to display tweets. It also features HTML and SCSS with responsive design for mobile and desktop screens, and light animations.
